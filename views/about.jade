          | OpenMatch is a project of 
          a(href='http://www.toeverywhere.net' target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold") toEverywhere
          | , an aggregator of carpools and rideshares, and we hope that through OpenMatch we can help seed more
          | ridesharing platforms to partner with us and hopefully contribute back to the aggregator's mobility network.

          | OpenMatchâ€™s mission is to improve the state of the carpooling market by giving individuals and organizations access
          | to free open sourced ridematching software that can be customized for any situation. By actively maintaining, updating,
          |  and creating modules for the software we hope to create a suite of tools for use in transportation demand management, mainly 
          | through our own efforts but also with the help of the community.
