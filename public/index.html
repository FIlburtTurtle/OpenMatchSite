          As experts in commercial as well as multi-family residential we address and 
          respect the divergent needs of retailers and residents.
          The key to executing well anchored mixed-use development is delivering a 
          finished product that is exciting for all stakeholders, from the retail anchor stores 
          to the residents. We feel that the creation of successful mixed-use developments 
          is part art and part science, where the balancing of demands to create a truly 
          acceptable site is the result of decades of experience.
          <br  /> <br  />
          Our relationships with credit retail tenants allows us to start the process of design 
          based on the demands and requirements of an anchor tenant use. We add to that 
          the experience with vertical multi-family development on small urban sites to 
          solve the complexities of access, security and exceptional views for the residential 
          component.
          <br  /> <br  />
          As municipalities trend toward requiring mixed-use developments to densify their 
          downtowns, we have focused our growth toward retailers who control sites and 
          want an experienced developer to add the residential component in an economic 
          and sensitive design on the site.

            Mr. Mitchell’s professional career started in the general contracting business in
            the mid 1980’s building office buildings, shopping centers and apartment projects. 
            He earned a Bachelor of Science Degree from Cal Poly University while working 
            as a general contractor. Upon graduation he entered the real estate development 
            business. Within five years he became a partner in a real estate development 
            company developing properties throughout five western states. While a partner 
            of Riley Pearlman Mitchell Company he developed 26 projects throughout 
            California and northern Nevada. Some of the tenants in these projects included 
            Target Stores, JC Penney, Walgreens, Safeway Inc., Raley’s, Wal-Mart, Home 
            Depot, Costco, Chase Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Union Bank, Starbucks Coffee and 
            many other national firms.
            <br  /><br  />
            From 1996 to 2013 as president of WT Mitchel Group Inc. he completed 17 
            ground-up retail and mixed-use projects. He has personally supervised the land 
            acquisition, governmental approvals, leasing, construction and management of 
            commercial projects ranging in size from a $200 thousand dollar T.I. to a $100 
            million dollar mixed-use development. He has successfully negotiated leases, 
            purchase contracts and development agreements with many of the country’s 
            most sophisticated companies. 
            <br  /><br  />
            In 2013, responding to a growing need for well-designed and integrated urban 
            mixed-use developments, Mr. Mitchell formed Urban Developers Inc., with Mr. 
            Dibartolomeo. Urban Developers currently has two transit-oriented mixed-
            use developments totaling 324 apartment homes and 260,000 square feet of 
            commercial space in development.
